___

The goal of this project is to have a look-back on 2020 from reddit's perspective. The site displays the top three upvoted posts for each day of the year. For a more in depth description of how reddit data was collected and processed check out my blog post [here](https://blog.claytn.now.sh/reddit-year-in-review/) (I'll try to move some of this information into the repository soon). Depending on the feedback for this "year in review", I may or may not continue this for 2021.
